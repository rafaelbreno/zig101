## What is Zig101
Zig101 is my documented journey studying the [Zig Language](https://ziglang.org/) as if I was explaining to someone.

## What is Zig
_"Zig is a general-purpose programming language and toolchain for maintaining robust, optimal and reusable software."_

### A Simple Language
_"Focus on debugging your application rather than debugging your programming language knowledge."_
- _"No hidden [control flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow)._
- _"No hidden [memory allocations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual_memory_management)."_ 
    - You will handle it manually
- _"No [preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor), no [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science))."_
